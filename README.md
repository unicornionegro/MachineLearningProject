School proje

It's school project, the goal is finding an optimal model for first 100 row, and then guess the last 20 with that model.

## What I've tried so far

- I've tried backward elimination and then eliminated features x1 and x4 just by looking at their p-values.
- I've tried applying cross validation to all of my subsets and then compare their rmse's. The subset without x1 and x4 has the smallest rmse. So I've predict the last 20 rows with that model.

## What I want to try

Been watching couple of tutorials on polynomial regression. I couldn't apply it succesfully though. I'm open to new tutorials or blog posts.
